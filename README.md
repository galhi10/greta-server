"Greta" is an intelligent irrigation system designed to automate household watering.  
Its operation is based on advanced sensors and an intelligent algorithm, ensuring optimal irrigation efficiency.  
The system incorporates a ground humidity sensor that measures moisture levels in real-time every hour, utilizing Arduino wifi and humidity sensors.  
Irrigation is initiated only when the humidity is low and there is no precipitation expected within the next 12 hours.

Key Components:  
1. Real-time ground sensor for accurate humidity measurement.  
2. Intelligent decision-making algorithm.  
3. Real-time weather API, covering cities worldwide.  

Benefits:  
1. Water conservation by irrigating only when necessary.  
2. Time and effort saved through automated irrigation.  
3. Promotion of healthier plant growth by avoiding overwatering or underwatering.  
4. Easy installation and user-friendly interface.  

The Big Data Algorithm:  
To determine the required amount of water for each irrigation, we employ a shared database that contains all the data from our users.  
This mutual database allows for real-time updates, ensuring irrigation calculations are based on the most up-to-date and relevant information.  
By utilizing this shared database, the irrigation system can be finely tuned to deliver the precise amount of water needed, reducing waste and maximizing efficiency.
